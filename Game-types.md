_Game types_ are usually defined by the ready sign. They contain a few game rules and override all config inputs.

## Why do I need this?
Usually, you do not need game types unless you would like to use one map for multiple purposes. Game types are easier to use than configurations and dungeon builders without access to the server files are able to use them without help. Game types define [game goals](https://github.com/DRE2N/DungeonsXL/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/github/dre2n/dungeonsxl/game/GameGoal.java) which is important for special games like Bedwars games.
