You are a developer and would like to contribute? Great, this is highly appreciated!

# Rules
* Follow the code style
* Try not to include bad programming practices. Keep the code object oriented!
* Try to stick to native Java, the Bukkit API and if applicable to the plugin for which you're adding an integration. Avoid Spigot API methods, CraftBukkit internals etc. and / or add fallback methods.
* Better create an issue first and ask if the feature is necessary. DungeonsXL is still in Beta stage. Because of the rapid changes, it is sometimes hard to merge changes made for older branches.

# To do
There are some feature requests which are not rejected, but are not part of the upcoming features list, neither. A list is available [here](changelog#unconfirmed). Pull requests fixing this issues will be accepted.
